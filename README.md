# How To Play
- Your goal is to click on all the cards without clicking the same card twice. 
- Each time you click a card, the order of the cards will shuffle, adding to the challenge.
- Continue clicking until you’ve clicked all the cards correctly to win the game.
- If you click a card you’ve already clicked before, the game is over.
